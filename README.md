# Chainer implementation of ssd

## TDD:
* Function stub
* Unit test
* Fail test
* Pass test
* Functiondoc

## TODO:
* Test for conv_shift
* Visualization of vgg as a unit test
* Add box regression
* Add rotation regression

## DONE:
* Unit test of vgg
* Stubs of methods

## TIPS:
* Exercise + flow is pretty powerful, linguistic abilities shut down but intuition kicks is
* Code only in the flow
